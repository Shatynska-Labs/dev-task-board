## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The server is local and refuses other hosts

The server SHALL bind `127.0.0.1`, on port 8766 or the one `--port` gives, SHALL print its address on standard output once listening, and SHALL answer 403 to a request whose `Host` is not `127.0.0.1:<port>` or `localhost:<port>`, the port being the one bound. A port in use, or one that cannot be bound, SHALL refuse the start with a message naming it.

#### Scenario: An unexpected host

- **WHEN** a request arrives with `Host` `evil.example`, `evil.example:<port>` or `127.0.0.1:<another port>`
- **THEN** it is answered 403

#### Scenario: The expected hosts

- **WHEN** a request arrives with `Host` `127.0.0.1:<port>` or `localhost:<port>`
- **THEN** it is answered normally

#### Scenario: A port in use

- **GIVEN** the port is taken
- **WHEN** the command starts
- **THEN** it exits non-zero, naming the port

### Requirement: Addresses reach workspaces and projects

`/<workspace>` SHALL be a workspace's overview and `/<workspace>/<project>` a project. With one workspace `/` SHALL answer as that workspace, and with several SHALL list them. Links SHALL percent-encode names. Any other address, including one that cannot be decoded, SHALL be answered 404. `/api/` SHALL stay reserved and answer 404 until a later change.

#### Scenario: One workspace

- **GIVEN** one workspace `work`
- **WHEN** `/` is requested
- **THEN** it shows the overview of `work`

#### Scenario: Several workspaces

- **GIVEN** workspaces `a` and `b`
- **WHEN** `/` is requested
- **THEN** it links to `/a` and `/b`

#### Scenario: An unknown address

- **WHEN** `/nobody`, `/work/nothing` or `/%E0` is requested
- **THEN** it is answered 404

### Requirement: The overview shows each project's state

A workspace's overview SHALL list its projects, each linking to its page, with its counts of tasks in flight and in total when read, that it is being read, or its failure's reason.

#### Scenario: Mixed states

- **GIVEN** a workspace with one read project, one being read and one failed
- **WHEN** the overview is requested
- **THEN** the first shows its counts, the second that it is being read, and the third its reason

### Requirement: A project's page shows its document

A read project's page SHALL show, in this order, tasks in work with their stage, active workstreams, other workstreams, and tasks in no workstream, each workstream opening with `<details>` to its steps and to the tasks whose `workstreams` name it but no step holds, marked as unplaced, and the document's `written_at`. Every task in the document SHALL appear. Status, stage and placement SHALL come from the document alone. A page for a project being read or failed SHALL say so, with the reason.

#### Scenario: The sections

- **GIVEN** a document fixture with a task in flight, an active workstream, an inactive one, a task in none and an unplaced task naming the active workstream
- **WHEN** the project's page is requested
- **THEN** each appears in its section, in that order, the workstream's steps are inside `<details>`, and the unplaced task is inside it, marked

#### Scenario: A project with no workstreams

- **GIVEN** a document with no workstreams
- **WHEN** the project's page is requested
- **THEN** its tasks are shown, and no workstream section appears

### Requirement: A partial forge read is noticed

A project page, and its row on the overview, SHALL say in one line that statuses may be wrong where the document's `forge` is not `full`.

#### Scenario: No forge

- **GIVEN** a document whose `forge` is `none`
- **WHEN** its page and overview are requested
- **THEN** each shows the notice

#### Scenario: A full forge

- **GIVEN** a document whose `forge` is `full`
- **WHEN** its page is requested
- **THEN** no notice appears

### Requirement: Document text is escaped

All text from a document, all names from settings, and every read's reason SHALL be escaped on render.

#### Scenario: Markup in a task

- **GIVEN** a task named `<script>alert(1)</script>`
- **WHEN** a page shows it
- **THEN** the markup appears as text, and no `<script>` element from it reaches the page

#### Scenario: Markup in a reason

- **GIVEN** a failed read whose reason holds `<b>`
- **WHEN** a page shows it
- **THEN** it appears as text
